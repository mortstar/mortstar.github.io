                <p class="lead mb-5">I graduated from the University of Warwick with a Masterâ€™s Degree and PhD in Physics in 2010. I then continued in scientific research, investigating magnetic resonance (MRI) physics at the CRMN in Lyon, France. Later I joined University of Oxford's Clarendon Laboratory, with research in the field of quantum computing. During this time, I taught undergraduate Physics courses at the University and Mansfield College and gained experience in the university admissions process. I am also a STEM Ambassador for science, carrying out lectures and workshops in Oxfordshire schools.</p>
